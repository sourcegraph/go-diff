# go-diff [![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/sourcegraph/go-diff/diff?status.svg)](https://godoc.org/github.com/sourcegraph/go-diff/diff)

Diff parser and printer for Go.

Installing
----------

```bash
go get -u github.com/sourcegraph/go-diff/diff
```

Usage
-----

It doesn't actually compute a diff. It only reads in (and prints out, given a Go struct representation) unified diff output, such as the following. The corresponding data structure in Go is the `diff.FileDiff` struct.
